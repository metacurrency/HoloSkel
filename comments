so I can see hwat you are saying
you have to be aware that all thses things are actually happening
you objecjtously have good ideas, mbut you have also the desire to operate as a team
if you want ed operate alone you would be doing theses things to make yourself more suvvessccul..
Every person;s time that is spoent working intheir own mind is more or less equally valuable#
so you can use this time you have spent doig this to interface with your own people
